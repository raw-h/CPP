Map is a data structure in which KEY-PAIR values are stored and these keys are mapped to corresponding values which can be accessed directly.
The data types of KEY and Values can be different also. Key can be an integer and Value can be string.
Maps are of 3 types: Maps, Unordered and Multimaps.
1. Maps:- Values are stored in sorted order with the reference of Keys. Map is stored in memory in pairs of Key-Value and they are not stored in memory in a continuous manner, but still they are linked to each other. Since they are not continuous the iterator in can't work like i = i + 1, nut still it can work like i++.
2. Unordered Maps:- Values are stored in random order, and because of this there's a difference in complexity of both Map and Unordered Map.
The data structure working behind Maps is Red Black Trees.
