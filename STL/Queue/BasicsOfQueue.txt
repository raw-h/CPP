Queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) Data Structure. The element entered first will be accessed in the first. And the element inserted at the last will be accessed at last.
There are 3 basic operations that can be carried out in case of a Queue data structure
    a. Push:- An element can be pushed at the end/back of the queue.
    b. Pop:- The first/front element of the queue is popped out.
    c. Front:- Accessing the first/front element of a queue.

Declaration:-
    queue<(datatype/data structure)> name_of_queue;

Functions:-
    a. name_of_queue.push(element); (To push an element in the end of queue).
    b. name_of_queue.pop(); (To pop the first/front element of the queue).
    c. name_of_queue.front(); (To access the front element in the queue, this is just for accessing the value and nothing else).
    d. name_of_queue.empty(); (Returns a boolean value either TRUE if queue is empty or FALSE if queue is not empty).
