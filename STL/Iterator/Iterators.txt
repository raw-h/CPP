Iterators are a crucial part of STL as in some containers(like maps, sets) where indexing is not applicable so we use iterators to operate on those conainers.
These are pointer like structures. These point at the elements of the containers.
The iterator that points to the first element of a vector is called .begin() iterator and the .end() iterator is used to point to the next thing/position after the last element.

(name_of_the_vector).begin() = v[0] & v.end() = next to last element / v[n+1].

Whenever we declare an iterator we have to type the whole container and datatype we are using.
Syntax of declaring an iterator  => vector<(datatype)> :: iterator (iterator_name) = (vector_name).begin();
And we extract values out of iterator just like we did with pointers.
eg: cout << *it << endl; For first element.
    cout << *(it+1) << endl; For second element.

In iterators we can do (iterator_name)++, it will move the iterator to the next iterator of that container and it is not same as (iterator_name) = (iterator_name) + 1;
And the above difference exists because when we do iterator++, the iterator moves to the next iterator of that container which gives us the next value of the container.
But iterator + 1 will give us the element in the next location in the memory and this will generate error in case of discontinuous containers like maps and sets.
