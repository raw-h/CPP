Tree is a non-linear data structure, where one node can be linked to multiple nodes.

Basic Terminologies:-
1. Node:- One element of a tree is known as Node and it keeps the data.
2. Root:- The node from which the tree starts is known as Root Node.
3. Childern:- The node which is below another node is is a Child to the node above.
4. Parent:- The node which is above another node is is a Parent to the node below.
5. Sibling:- The child nodes having same parent are known as Siblings.
6. Ancestors:- All the nodes(connected to the subject node) above the taken node are it's Ancestors.
7. Descendant:- All the nodes(connected to the subject node) below the taken node are it's Descendants.
8. Leaf:- The node which has no child is known as Leaf node.

Binary Tree is a type of tree where there are 2 or less than 2 children at each of the following levels.
Structure of a node in Binary Tree:-
node{
    int data;
    node left;
    node right;
}

For a tree to have multiple children the structure of the tree must be like :-
node{
    int data;
    list<node*> child;
}
