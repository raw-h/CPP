Linked List is a type of dynamic linear data structure which is a collection of nodes. A node consists of 2 things data and pointer to the address of next node.
Linked List is used to overcome some of thr disadvantages of arrays and vectors and it helps in growing and shrinking our list in runtime which prevents memory wastage. 
No shifting is needed if insertion is to be performed in the middle of the list.
Linked list is not stored in a contiguous block of memory, it takes the free blocks present in heap.

The first node is called the head.
Types of Linked List:-
    1. Singly LL:- When we have only data and next in a LL and going into only one direction.
    2. Doubly LL:- The structure for a node of doubly LL is (previous pointer) (data) (next pointer). The previous of the first node points and next of the last node points to NULL.
    3. Circular LL:- In this type of LL the last node points to the first node except of NULL, singly LL can be converted to circular and doubly LL can also be converted of circular.
