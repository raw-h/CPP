Linked List is a type of dynamic linear data structure which is a collection of nodes. A node consists of 2 things data and poninter to the address of next node.
Linked List is used to overcome some of thr disadvantages of arrays and vectors. The first node is called the head.

    1. Singly LL:- When we have only data and next in a LL and going into only one direction.
    2. Doubly LL:- The structure for a node of doubly LL is (previous pointer) (data) (next pointer). The previous of the first node points and next of the last node points to NULL.
    3. Circular LL:-
