What is Heap -> It is a Complete Binary Tree that comes with a Heap order property.
Complete Binary Tree is a tree, where every level is completely filled except the last level, nodes are always added from the left or they always lean towards the left.
In a CBT, there are a particular number of leaf nodes which is from (n/2 + 1) to n, where n is the size of the heap. And since these are leaf nodes they don't need to be processed.

According to the Heap Order Property, we have 2 types of Heaps:-
1. Max Heap:- Here the parent node's data is always greater than the data of it's child nodes. 
2. Min Heap:- Here the parent node's data is always lower than the data of it's child nodes. 

Here we will implement Max Heap using Arrays.

Insertion:- Here node will be the i-th index.
            Left child will be accessed by (2 * i). 
            Right child will be accessed by (2 * i + 1).
            To visit the parent from any child we will do (i / 2).
Time complexity of insertion in Max heap is O(logN).

Deletion:- Here we are deleting the data of the first(root) node and then adjusting the whole tree to follow the property of Max Heap.
        Step 1:- Copy the value of last node into the first node, i.e arr[1].
        Step 2:- Reduce the size by 1.
        Step 3:- Adjust the tree according to the properties of a Complete Binary Tree.
Time complexity of Deletion is also O(logN). 

Heapify Algorithm:- The function of this algorithm is to take a node and insert it to it's correct position according to the heap's property.
If this algorithm is called on an index, it will heapfy the remaining array, i.e from that particular index to the size of the array.
It also works in O(logN), and when we are building a heap inside the for loop in the main function it happens in O(N).

In Heap Sort we will build a heap if direct array input is given, and then we will sort it.
Time Complexity of Heap Sort is N*logN.

We can easily implement Heaps using Priority queue, inside the header file "queue". By default it implements Max Heap,
the syntax is priority_queue(data_type) (name of heap). Eg priority_queue<int> pq;

We can also implement min heap using Priority queue by the following syntax priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
